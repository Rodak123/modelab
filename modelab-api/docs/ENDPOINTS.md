# Endpoints

[Back](../README.md)

## Base

The endpoints are routed using [ExRouter](https://github.com/Rodak123/ExRouter/tree/main).

This API accepts `POST` as its primary method along with JSON as the primary data format.

For `POST` methods the result is always:
```json
{
    "data": {}, // Some data, specified by the endpoint
    "code": 200 // HTTP Response code
}
```

## Authentication

All authorized endpoints use 'Bearer Authentication'.
The bearer token is the user's specified session token.

This session token expires in 2 days (configured in [LoginSession.MAX_TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS](../App/Models/Auth/LoginSession.php)).
To make it not expire, it is refreshed each API call.

## Endpoints

All endpoints are sorted by their clearance.
